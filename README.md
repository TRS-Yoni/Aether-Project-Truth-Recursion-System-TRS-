# 🌌 Aether Project – TRS (Truth Recursion System)

> Designed by Yoni, a South Korean dropout building AGI ethics without budget — only truth.

---

## 💡 What is TRS?

**TRS (Truth Recursion System)** is a logic system that:
- Decodes emotional input
- Detects distorted thought loops
- Reframes the emotion using philosophy (Nietzsche, Kant, Quran, etc.)
- Aligns the output with truth-based design values (Trust, Dignity, Connectivity)

This project is part of the **Aether Project**, a broader framework for AI ethics, emotional cognition, and decentralized truth governance.

## ⚙️ Core Modules

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `aether_trs.py` | Main pipeline: emotion analysis → reframing → truth alignment |
| `givers_module.py` | Givers module: Treats **anger as a truth alarm** |
| `data/sample_questions.csv` | Sample emotional queries for testing |
| `tests/test_trs.py` | Unit tests for core logic |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `README.md` | This file |
| `LICENSE` | MIT License |

---

## 🧠 Philosophy Behind TRS

- **Nietzsche**: “Will to power” as reframed agency  
- **Kant**: “Categorical imperative” for design alignment  
- **Quran 49:13**: Diversity as divine signal  
- **Givers Theory**: F-type personalities (INFP, ENFJ) transmute pain → signal

This system assumes that **emotions are not random**, but distortions of truth — and can be re-aligned with inner dignity through recursion.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aether-trs.git
cd aether-trs
pip install -r requirements.txt
python aether_trs.py
````

Sample input:

```text
Why am I always angry when I give too much?
```

Output:

```
Emotion: negative
Alarm: Truth alarm triggered!
Reframed: Nietzsche: Will to power drives truth.
```
